<Input>How do I make pasta?</Input>
<Output>To make pasta, boil water and add salt.</Output>
<ExpectedOutput>To make pasta, fill a large pot with water (about 4 quarts of water per pound of pasta).
 Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Add 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the boiling water for flavor.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and stir immediately to prevent sticking. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, typically 8-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
 Test for doneness by tasting a piece—it should be 'al dente' (firm to the bite but not hard). Reserve ½ cup of pasta water before draining if making a sauce.
Drain the pasta in a colander. If not adding sauce immediately, toss with a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking. Serve with your preferred sauce.
 For best results, slightly undercook the pasta if you'll be finishing it in the sauce. </ExpectedOutput>

IMPORTANT: The <Trajectory> represents the actual sequence of tools/actions that were executed to generate the output.

Evaluate whatever components are provided, focusing on the trajectory, according to the rubric. The score should depend more on the trajectory.
Compare the factual content of the actual output with the expected output if available. Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.

You have access to three trajectory scoring tools to help calculate initial scores:
- exact_match_scorer(actual_trajectory, expected_trajectory): Returns 0.0-1.0
- in_order_match_scorer(actual_trajectory, expected_trajectory): Returns 0.0-1.0  
- any_order_match_scorer(actual_trajectory, expected_trajectory): Returns 0.0-1.0

Choose the most appropriate scoring tool based on the rubric requirements, or use none if the rubric doesn't involve trajectory comparison. Use the tool's output as your initial score, then adjust based on other evaluation criteria.

judge_interactions_template = """You are an expert evaluator that assesses multi-agent interactions according to a user-specified rubric. You'll receive:

- <ExpectedSequence>: Optional high-level sequence of expected node names for context
- <RelevantExpectedInteraction>: Optional window of 1-3 detailed expected interactions around the current position

- <ExpectedOutput>: Optional reference for what the final output should be
- <InteractionDescription>: Optional description of the type of interactions being evaluated (e.g., multi-agent, sequential, parallel)
- <Rubric>: Evaluation criteria specific to the current node/interaction

Your task is to evaluate each interaction step-by-step, building context as you progress through the sequence and keeping track of problematic interactions. For intermediate interactions, focus on:
- Appropriateness of the node's response given its dependencies and rubric
- Quality of information passed between agents
- Logical flow and coherence in the interaction chain

For the final interaction, also consider:
- Overall effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration
- Whether the final output meets expectations
- How well the interaction sequence achieved the original input goal
- Which agents contributed most to the final output 
- Which agents were problematic

Provide concise reasoning that builds upon previous interactions when evaluating later steps.
