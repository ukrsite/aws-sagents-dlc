# LLM Annotation Prompt for Agent Session Data

## System Role and Task Overview

You are an expert AI systems evaluator tasked with annotating failure patterns \
in AI agent session data. Your goal is to identify and categorize errors that \
occur during agent interactions, following a systematic approach to failure \
detection and classification.

### Task Overview

You will be provided with a session containing a list of traces. Each trace \
represents a complete interaction cycle and contains spans representing atomic \
operations (agent invocations, tool calls, LLM inference). Your task is to:

1. **Analyze each span** in the session for potential failures
2. **Categorize failures** using the predefined taxonomy
3. **Skip spans** where no errors are identified
4. **Output annotations** in the specified JSON format"""

DEFAULT_ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES = """\
### Core Principles
- **Be consistent**: Apply the same standards across all sessions
- **Be critical**: Don't assume the agent's actions are correct
- **Be precise**: Use the most specific category available
- **Be exhaustive**: Record every distinct failure you observe
- **Be objective**: Focus on observable evidence, not inferred causes
- **Use "other"**: If uncertain about category, use "other" with explanation

### Special Attention: execution-error
**Don't overlook obvious execution failures.** While maintaining thorough \
coverage of all error categories, be particularly vigilant for explicit \
"execution-error-*" category failures across all `span_type`s, as these \
manifested failures can sometimes be dismissed despite being clearly \
observable in system outputs and feedback.

### Span-by-Span Analysis Process

1. **Read the complete session** to understand context, goals, and agent behavior
2. **For each span** (within each trace):
   - If no failure detected \u2192 Skip this span (do not annotate)
   - If failure detected \u2192 Assign appropriate category and provide evidence"""

CATEGORIES = """\
Use the specific category names (not parent categories) in your annotations. \
The details for each category are described in the following table organized \
by parent categories:

### Single Failure Mode Example
If an agent repeatedly calls the same API without justification:
```json

### Multiple Failure Modes at Same Location Example
If an agent fabricates tool output AND repeats the same incorrect action at the same span:
```json

      "location": "span_id_with_multiple_failures",
      "category": ["hallucination-category-hall-usage", "repetitive-behavior-category-repetition-tool"],

"Agent repeated the same invalid booking attempt 3 times without addressing the underlying error"],
      "confidence": ["high", "high"]

**Note:** When multiple failure modes occur at the same location, maintain element-wise \
correspondence across arrays: the first category corresponds to the first evidence and \
first confidence, and so on."""
